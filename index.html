  <h1>Welcome to <code>napoleon</code>!</h1>

  <p>
    This is a general-purpose experimentation/development server for
    the <a href="http://hiperfit.dk">HIPERFIT</a> research centre.
  </p>

    <h2>Getting an account</h2>

    <p>
      If you want an account on <code>napoleon</code>, please send an email
      to <code>athas@sigkill.dk</code> with your desired user name
      and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/">your
      public SSH key</a>.  For security reasons, password-based login is
      explicitly <em>not</em> permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>napoleon</code> webserver has been configured with user
      directories such that URL <code>napoleon.hiperfit.dk/~<em>user</em></code>
      is mapped to the folder <code>/home/<em>user</em>/public_html</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Creating an account</h2>

    <p>
      If Troels is unavaiable or grumpy, anyone with <code>root</code> access
      can add new acounts as well.  This is unfortunately not a fully automated
      process.  You can can use the YaST tool via <code>sudo yast2</code>, but
      it is probably easier to just use the Unix commands directly.  First, add
      the user:
    </p>

    <kbd>
      $ sudo useradd -m -g video <em>username</em>
    </kbd>

    <p>
      The <kbd>-g video</kbd> part is for GPU access, and can be skipped
      if the user does not intend to use the GPUs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <code>napoleon</code> does not permit password-pased login,
      you will then have to create an <code>authorized_keys</code> file
      and enter their public key:
    </p>

    <kbd>
      $ sudo -u <em>username</em> mkdir -p /home/<em>username</em>/.ssh/ <br>
      $ sudo -u <em>username</em> emacs /home/<em>username</em>/.ssh/authorized_keys
    </kbd>

    <p>
      That should be it.
    </p>

    <h2>Updating this website</h2>

    <p>
      This is a static website
      maintained <a href="https://github.com/HIPERFIT/napoleon">on Github</a>.
      Every hour, a cronjob (<kbd>crontab -e</kbd>) running as
      the <code>napoleon</code> user will perform a <kbd>git pull</kbd> to
      synchronise.

    <h2>Hardware specifications</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Two AMD Opteron 6274 processors, each with 16 cores.  Fairly bad
        sequential performance and
        extreme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access">NUMA
        behaviour.</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        128 GiB of RAM.
      </li>

      <li>
        Two NVIDIA GeForce GTX 690 cards, each containing two physical GPUs.
        Terrible double-precision performance.
      </li>

      <li>
        One AMD FireGL 8100 graphics card, which has a lot of very fast memory
        and excellent double-precision performance.
      </li>

      <li>
        Permanent storage:
        <ul>
          <li>128GiB SSD used for the root partition.</li>
          <li>Old 1TiB disk used for ancillary storage (<code>/hiperfit</code>).</li>
          <li>New 6TiB disk used for <code>/home</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>None of this is automatically backed up.</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>System setup</h2>

    <p>
      <code>napoleon</code> runs OpenSUSE (13.2 as of this writing), as this was
      the GNU/Linux distribution preferred by the IT department at the faculty of
      SCIENCE at the time the server was installed.
      </p>

    <p>
      The setup of <code>napoleon</code> is mostly conventional, although the
      GPU driver setup is a little strange:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Having both the NVIDIA kernel modules (<code>nvidia</code>
        and <code>nvidia_uvm</code>) and the AMD kernel module
        (<code>fglrx</code>) loaded is no problem.
      </li>

      <li>
        Neither is having two (or more) OpenCL ICDs.  These are simply stored in
        the <code>/etc/OpenCL/vendors/</code> directory.
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>However</em>, the AMD OpenCL ICD goes grovelling
        for <code>libGL.so</code> libraries and tries to load whatever it finds
        for OpenCL/OpenGL-interoperability, presumably under the assumption that
        they contain an AMD OpenGL implementation.
      </li>

      <li>
        They do not.
      </li>

      <li>
        In fact, it will eventually find the NVIDIA-supplied <code>libGL</code>
        libraries and get horribly confused.  This generally manifests as OpenCL
        initialisation function locking up at runtime.
      </li>

      <li>
        NVIDIAs <code>libGL.so</code> comes from the
        package <code>x11-video-nvidiaG04</code>.  For reasons that are no doubt
        magical in nature, this is also the package that contains the
        critical <code>libnvidia-compiler.so</code> library, so it is not
        possible to merely remove <code>x11-video-nvidiaG04</code> - at least
        not if you still want to run OpenCL programs on NVIDIA.
      </li>

      <li>
        At this point, the impatient PhD student manning <code>napoleon</code>
        got frustrated and simply deleted every file whose name
        resembled <code>libGL.so</code> from the system.  If you ever need to
        reinstall <code>napoleon</code>, or wish to setup a multi-vendor
        GPU-machine (don't), try something similar.
      </li>
    </ul>
