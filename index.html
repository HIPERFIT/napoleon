  <h1>Welcome to <tt>napoleon</tt>!</h1>

  This is a general-purpose experimentation/development server
  for the <a href="http://hiperfit.dk">HIPERFIT</a> research centre.

    <h2>Getting an account</h2>

    <p>
      If you want an account on <tt>napoleon</tt>, please send an
      email to <tt>athas@sigkill.dk</tt> with your desired user name
      and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/">your
      public SSH key</a>.  For security reasons, password-based login
      is explicitly <em>not</em> permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <tt>napoleon</tt> webserver has been configured with user
      directories such that
      URL <tt>napoleon.hiperfit.dk/~<em>user</em></tt> is mapped to the
      folder <tt>/home/<em>user</em>/public_html</tt>.
    </p>

    <h2>Creating an account</h2>

    <p>
      If Troels is unavaiable or grumpy, anyone with <tt>root</tt>
      access can add new acounts as well.  This is unfortunately not a
      fully automated process.  You can can use the YaST tool
      via <tt>sudo yast2</tt>, but it is probably easier to just use
      the Unix commands directly.  First, add the user:
    </p>

      <code>
        $ sudo useradd -m -g video <em>username</em>
      </code>

    <p>
      The <tt>-g video</tt> part is for GPU access, and can be skipped
      if the user does not intend to use the GPUs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <tt>napoleon</tt> does not permit password-pased login,
      you will then have to create an <tt>authorized_keys</tt> file
      and enter their public key:
    </p>

      <code>
        $ sudo -u <em>username</em> mkdir -p /home/<em>username</em>/.ssh/ <br>
        $ sudo -u <em>username</em> emacs /home/<em>username</em>/.ssh/authorized_keys
      </code>

    <p>
      That should be it.
    </p>

    <h2>Updating this website</h2>

      This is a static website
      maintained <a href="https://github.com/HIPERFIT/napoleon">on
        Github</a>.  Every hour, a cronjob (<tt>crontab -e</tt>) running
      as thne <tt>napoleon</tt> user will perform a <tt>git pull</tt> to
      synchronise.

    <h2>Hardware specifications</h2>

    <ul>
      <li> Two AMD Opteron 6274 processors, each with 16 cores.
        Fairly bad sequential performance and
        extreme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access">NUMA
          behaviour</a>.

      <li>128 GiB of RAM.</li>

      <li> Two NVIDIA GeForce GTX 690 cards, each containing two
        physical GPUs.  Terrible double-precision performance.

      <li> One AMD FireGL 8100 graphics card, which has a lot of very
        fast memory and excellent double-precision performance.

      <li> Permanent storage:
        <ul>
          <li> 128GiB SSD used for the root partition.
          <li> Old 1TiB disk used for ancillary storage (<tt>/hiperfit</tt>)
          <li> New 6TiB disk used for <tt>/home</tt>.
        </ul>
        <strong>None of this is automatically backed up.</strong>
    </ul>

    <h2>System setup</h2>

    <tt>napoleon</tt> runs OpenSUSE (13.2 as of this writing), as this
    was the GNU/Linux distribution preferred by the IT department at
    the faculty of SCIENCE at the time the server was installed.

    The setup of <tt>napoleon</tt> is mostly conventional, although
    the GPU driver setup is a little strange:
    <ul>
      <li> Having both the NVIDIA kernel modules (<tt>nvidia</tt>
        and <tt>nvidia_uvm</tt>) and the AMD kernel module
        (<tt>fglrx</tt>) loaded is no problem.

      <li> Neither is having two (or more) OpenCL ICDs.  These are
        simply stored in the <tt>/etc/OpenCL/vendors/</tt> directory.

      <li> <em>However</em>, the AMD OpenCL ICD goes grovelling
        for <tt>libGL.so</tt> libraries and tries to load whatever it
        finds for OpenCL/OpenGL-interoperability, presumably under the
        assumption that they contain an AMD OpenGL implementation.

      <li> They do not.

      <li> In fact, it will eventually find the
        NVIDIA-supplied <tt>libGL</tt> libraries and get horribly
        confused.  This generally manifests as OpenCL initialisation
        function locking up at runtime.

      <li>NVIDIAs <tt>libGL.so</tt> comes from the
        package <tt>x11-video-nvidiaG04</tt>.  For reasons that are no
        doubt magical in nature, this is also the package that contains
        the critical <tt>libnvidia-compiler.so</tt> library, so it is
        not possible to merely remove <tt>x11-video-nvidiaG04</tt> - at
        least not if you still want to run OpenCL programs on NVIDIA.

      <li>At this point, the impatient PhD student
        manning <tt>napoleon</tt> got frustrated and simply deleted
        every file whose name resembled <tt>libGL.so</tt> from the
        system.  If you ever need to reinstall <tt>napoleon</tt>, or
        wish to setup a multi-vendor GPU-machine (don't), try
        something similar.
    </ul>
